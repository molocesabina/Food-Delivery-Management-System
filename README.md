# Food-Delivery-Management-System
A food delivery management system for a catering company. The client can 
order products from the company's menu. The system has three types of users that log in 
using a username and a password: administrator, regular employee, and client.


Worked with lambda expressions and stream processing for generating the 
administrator specific reports and to implement the search 
functionalities available to the client.

Uses Composite Design Pattern for modelling the classes MenuItem, BaseProduct, 
CompositeProduct and Observer Design Pattern to notify each time a 
new Order is added.
